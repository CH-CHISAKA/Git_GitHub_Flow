# Git Workflows 101
This is designed to understand GitHub Flow while understanding alternative Git workflows.

Focus areas on: team governance, branch protection, and explicit merging - maintaining a clear audit trail.

## 1. Overview of Git Workflows 
Understanding these 3 -three primary workflows used in the industry:
* __GitHub Flow__: Ideal for agile teams and web applications. It relies on a single `main` branch that must always be in a deployable state. Feature branches are used for all changes.
* **Git Flow**: A more structured approach with multiple long-lived branches (`main`, `dev`, `release`, `feature`, and `bug`). It is ideal for installable applications (like mobile apps) where multiple versions run simultaneously.
* **Trunk-Based Development**: The current industry standard (2026) for  large-scale SaaS. It uses direct commits to `main` or very short-lived feature branches (~4 hours) and relies on "feature flags" and bulletproof automated testing.

## 2. Branch Protection and Repository Setup
Case Scenario - 5 Group members working on a project

__Member 1__ will act as the "team lead" for this lab.

1. __Confirm that your Team Members are Collaborators__: Go to __Settings__ > **Collaborators**. One should see all the members listed with "Write" access or "Admin" access
